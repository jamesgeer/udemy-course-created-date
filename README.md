## Building

Navigate to the project using your terminal and use the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

Or, for Yarn users:

- `yarn`
- `yarn build`

This will create a `dist/` directory containing the transpiled code.

## Tests

Tests are located in `src/__tests__`.

To run the tests use the following commands:

- `npm run test`

Yarn:

- `yarn test`


## How to use

Simply navigate to a course page on Udemy and the creation date will appear. [Try it!](https://www.udemy.com/course/rustaceans/) (I have no association with this course).
